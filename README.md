# ASCII-Adventure
A personal project, based off of an old school project, that I used to familiarize myself with C#

This project lays the base work to be built upon for an ASCII game if I ever return to it. It runs in the console displaying ASCII characters that all represent different game objects from walls to the payer to notes and doors.
